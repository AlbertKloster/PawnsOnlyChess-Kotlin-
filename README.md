# Stage 4/5: Capture
## Description
Let's add pawn captures. Capture is a move of a pawn when an opposite color pawn stands one square to the left or right on a diagonal. The attacking pawn takes the position of the captured pawn; the captured pawn is taken off the chessboard.

White's turn. All possible captures.

Black's turn. All possible captures.

<b>En passant</b> is a special type of pawn capture. A white pawn is on the 5th rank. A black pawn is on the adjacent file (a vertical line); the black pawn (this should be its first move in the game) moves 2 squares forward, passing the white pawn. The white pawn can capture the black pawn by moving forward diagonally. The capture should be done right away, otherwise, the right to the en passant capture is lost:

For Black, the situation is the direct opposite. A black pawn is on the 4th rank. A white pawn is on the adjacent file (a vertical line); the white pawn (this should be its first move in the game) moves 2 squares forward passing the black pawn. The black pawn can capture the white pawn by moving forward diagonally. The capture should be done right away, otherwise, the right to the en passant capture is lost:

## Objectives
The program should recognize all pawn captures and valid moves (once again, en passant captures are valid for <b>one move only</b>). If a player inputs a valid capture, then the program should move the capturing pawn forward and diagonally on the chessboard and remove the captured pawn from the chessboard. Don't forget to add the functionality from the previous stages.

## Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
