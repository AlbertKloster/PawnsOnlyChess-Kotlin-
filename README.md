# Stage 5/5: Win conditions
## Description
Our game is almost complete. One more thing remains — we need to establish the win/draw conditions.

The game is over when either player succeeds in moving their pawn to the last opposite rank — <b>rank 8</b> for White, <b>rank 1</b> for Black. The game is also over when all opposite pawns are captured.

Stalemate (draw) occurs when a player can't make any valid move on their turn.

## Objectives
The program should check whether the winning or stalemate conditions are met <b>after each turn</b>.

If the winning conditions are fulfilled, print `White Wins!` or `Black Wins!`, depending on the situation. Then, print `Bye!` and exit the program.

If it's a <b>stalemate</b>, print `Stalemate! Bye!` and exit the program.

## Examples
<b>Example 1:</b> <i>White wins by moving a pawn across the whole board</i>
